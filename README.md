 # Decentralized Applications (dApps)
 
## Motivation

The biggest revolution that decentralized peer-to-peer networks has given us (techy guys like myself) was a decentralized economy. By reducing the power and influence of centralized entities, such as big tech companies and governments. This allows for a more transparent, equitable, and democratic internet that promotes fair distribution of resources and opportunities. One of the most well known examples are the Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) which operate on decentralized platforms and are governed by smart contracts. They enable collective decision-making and resource allocation based on community consensus, fostering collaboration, and shared ownership. Nevertheless, we must not make the mistake of assuming that nothing can go wrong. With the power of decentralization comes the responsibility of ensuring we are properly informed and not everyone is comfortable taking their commercial journey into their own hands.
